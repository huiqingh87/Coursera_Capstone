    "Both Toronto and New York are two big cities in North America. With the close connection between Canada and the U.S. governments, there are a strong need of population immigration for both cities' dwellers. It is important for those people interested in two places to know what are the similarities as well as the differences between two cities. In this lab, I will use all the knowledge and coding skills I learned from previous courses to conduct a comparative analysis for the targetted cities. The major problems I am interested here includes:\n",
    "    <ol style=\"margin-left:60px\">\n",
    "    <li>**Is the city urban structure of Toronto similar to or different from the NYC?**</li>\n",
    "    <li>**Which dimensions are those similarities or differences**</li>\n",
    "    </ol>"

    "This lab will use two neighborhood boundary datasets from the municipalities and the neighborhood venus data obtained with the Foursquare API. First, I will convert spatial and non-spatial data (neighborhood names/addresses) into their equivalent latitude and longitude values. I will use the explore function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and use search function to get the specific category of nenthen use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. The k-means clustering algorithm is adopted in the clustering analysis to capture the similarities and differences between two cities. Finally, I will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in Toronto and NYC and their emerging clusters.\n"
