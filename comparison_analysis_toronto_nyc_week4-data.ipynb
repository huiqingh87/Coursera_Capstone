    "This lab will use two neighborhood boundary datasets from the municipalities and the neighborhood venus data obtained with the Foursquare API. I will use the **explore** function to get the most common venue categories in each neighborhood, and use **search** function to get the specific category of nenthen use this feature to group the neighborhoods into clusters. You will use the _k_-means clustering algorithm to complete this task. Finally, you will use the Folium library to visualize the neighborhoods in New York City and their emerging clusters.\n",

The Toronto data is in spatial format (GeoJSON) and I will use the GeoPandas library to preprocess it while the NYC data is in JSON format which is cleaned by json package. Both datasets will have the same columns at the end, namely Neighborhood Name, Latitude, Longitude, which will be sent to Foursquare API to obtain venus information."
